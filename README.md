## Self-Healing Epoxy ML Pipeline

This script trains a Random Forest model to predict impedance in epoxy coatings,
applies Bayesian-style prediction, and outputs optimized formulations.

### How to Use:
- Upload `combinations_dataset.csv`
- Run `epoxy_ml_pipeline.py`
- Visuals and top formulations will be saved automatically
